      <h1>Michaela's Journey</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Michaela. <br>
      I'm a 23 year old with a past that, personally, I believe isn't so bright. <br>
      October 4th, 2022 is when I finally understood how to live my life.</p>

      <p>This is me on April 14, 2018.<br>
      It was one of the happiest times that I could remember myself up until now.<br>
      I was rebuilt, renewed, rediscovered.<br>
      But I let all of that go, packed happiness up in a box, and forgot where I put it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I realize that this may seem a little sad, but I'm actually here to tell you<br>how I found it again.
      It wasn't easy, and to be honest, I'm not fully there myself,<br>but maybe this will help someone else out along the way.</p>
      <br>
      <p>On October 4th I had an epiphany. It's one that shouldn't have taken me this long to figure out:<br>
        We only get one life to live, and we get to choose how we live it.<br>
        So do I really want to live the rest of my life miserable and unhappy?<br>
        Do I want to leave this Earth knowing that I wasted the only life I get?
